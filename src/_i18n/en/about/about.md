# About an author
My name is Pavel, I'm a software developer. I have more than 10 years of software development experience. I have 
participated in development of:

- backend and frontend of various sites;

In my free time I read about new things in software development, learn new programming languages,
read technical books and articles from famous programmers and share obtained knowledge and my thoughts
with my small audience.
